# PWA Icon Creation Guide

## Quick Icon Creation Options

### Option 1: Use an Online Icon Generator

1. Visit [PWA Builder Icon Generator](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator)
2. Upload your logo/icon image
3. Download the generated icons
4. Copy `icon-192x192.png` and `icon-512x512.png` to your `public/` folder

### Option 2: Use Existing Images

If you have any square images (logos, screenshots, etc.):

1. Resize to 192x192 and 512x512 pixels using:
    - Online tools like [ResizeImage.net](https://resizeimage.net/)
    - Image editors like GIMP, Photoshop, or Paint.NET
    - Command line tools like ImageMagick

### Option 3: Use Placeholder Icons

For testing, you can use simple colored squares:

1. Create 192x192 and 512x512 solid color PNG images
2. Name them `icon-192x192.png` and `icon-512x512.png`
3. Place in the `public/` folder

### Option 4: Command Line (if you have ImageMagick)

```bash
# Create simple placeholder icons
magick -size 192x192 xc:"#6366f1" public/icon-192x192.png
magick -size 512x512 xc:"#6366f1" public/icon-512x512.png
```

## Icon Requirements

-   **Format**: PNG
-   **Sizes**: 192x192 and 512x512 pixels
-   **Background**: Should have a background (not transparent for better PWA support)
-   **Content**: Should represent your app (logo, chat bubble, AI symbol, etc.)

## File Locations

Place the icons in your project:

```
public/
├── icon-192x192.png
├── icon-512x512.png
├── manifest.json
└── sw.js
```

Once you add these icons, your PWA will be fully functional and installable!
